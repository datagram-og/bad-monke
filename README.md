# bad-monke

## description

Bad Monke is a user script for blocking users on the JungleTV.live site.  

It's a quick and dirty script written quickly by someone who isn't a web developer, so there might be issues or better ways to do things although my goal was simplicity.

You can choose to block people temporarily (until the next day) or permanently (until you clear your browser's local storage).

## requirements

You will need a browser extension like Tampermonkey, which is what I used to develop this on the Brave browser.  I haven't tested any other browsers or Greasemonkey.

## installation

After you've installed Tampermonkey, navigate to Bad.Monke.user.js in this repository, and then click on the "Raw" button, which should prompt you for installation.

#credits

Credit goes to the Banano Discord user Lyeawden#1647, who posted the original snippet for use as a bookmark to block users on a per-session basis.

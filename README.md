## description

Bad Monke is a user script for blocking users on the JungleTV.live site.  

It's a quick and dirty script written quickly by someone who isn't a web developer, so there might be issues or better ways to do things although my goal was simplicity.

You can choose to block people temporarily (until the next day) or permanently (until you clear your browser's local storage).

## requirements

You will need a browser extension like Tampermonkey, which is what I used to develop this on the Brave browser.  I haven't tested any other browsers or Greasemonkey.

## installation and use

After you've installed Tampermonkey, navigate to Bad.Monke.user.js in this repository, and then click on the "Raw" button, which should prompt you for installation.

Refresh the JungleTV page and you should see a new button with a "No" symbol over a monkey.  Click this button for prompts to block users.  

For the second prompt, you can just enter the first letter of the choices, "P" or "T", but don't use quotes or square brackets.
